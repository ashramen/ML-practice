# ML-practice ðŸ“ˆ

[Jupyter Notebook](ML-Practice.ipynb) I created to teach myself machine learning principles. Uses 1150000 rows Ã— 11 columns dataset on shopping data from a store chain.

I experimented with feature engineering, data visualization, data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, and several ML models for classification. 

Final model achieved ~91% accuracy using CatBoost gradient boosting to predict whether a given customer will become a repeat customer.
